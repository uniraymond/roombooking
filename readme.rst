<h1>Room Booking System<h1>
This roombooking has been using Codeigniter3 as php server side
jQuery, Bootstrap, and jQuery Ui have been used on frontend.

1. On user field just typing the user first name, last name or user_id keywords and the user will be autocompleted on the field.
2. When we choose a user and then the room will be limited as the user group, such as student only can use student room, staff can use student and staff room, professor can use student, staff and professor room, and others can use all rooms (I think this part if we can use drop down selection will be better for choosing a room)
3. If the room has been booked and the system will give an alert for the room has been booked in the time.
4. If booking the room over the the room open time the last field will give alert for cannot use the room in the hours.
5. If the room has been choosed the last Booking Hours max hours will be changed as will.
6. add a booking and remove a booking have been using AJAX and displaying on the booking details table.

Thank You
